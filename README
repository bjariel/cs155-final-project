interactive_field.py was our first attempt at mouse tracking to change a vector field

int_field.py was a version of mouse tracking that added particles moving on the vector field
    the class InteractiveVectorField is a version using matplotlib
    the class InteractiveParticles is a version using pynput

    both attempts had issues with particles disappearing after mouse interactions
